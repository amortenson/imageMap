The Muffin Man is seated at the table in the laboratory of the Utility Muffin Research Kitchen . . .
Reaching for an oversized chrome spoon, he gathers an intimate quantity of dried muffin remnants.
And brushing his scapular aside, proceeds to dump these inside of his shirt. . .
He turns to us and speaks: "Some people like cupcakes better. I for one care less for them!"
Arrogantly twisting the sterile canvas snoot of a fully charged icing anointment utensil,
He pools forth a quarter-ounce green rosette near the summit of a dense but radiant muffin of his own design.
Later he says: "Some people . . . some people like cupcakes exclusively,
while I myself say there is naught nor ought there be, nothing so exalted on the faceof God's grey earth
As that prince of foods . . . The Muffin!
